# InfinityCamera
This is a back-end camera add-on application which interacts with the intents launched when a device camera clicks a picture, and saves it on Dropbox cloud. It is focused to eradicate your disability to capture a picture solely because of shortage of memory in your device. All you have to do is, install the application, enable the upload functionality, provide a one-time credentials to Dropbox, and you are all set. Once you capture a picture from any of the camera application, your picture will be automatically saved on Dropbox. The setting can be enabled/disabled anytime from the application console.
