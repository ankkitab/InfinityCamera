# InfinityCamera
This is a backend camera application which interacts with the intents launched when your device camera clicks a picture, and saves it on cloud.
It is focussed to eradicate your disability to capture a picture solely because of shortage of memory in your device.
All you have to do is, install the application, enable the upload functionality, provide a one-time credentials to dropbox, and you are all set.
Once you capture a picture from any of the camera application, your picture will be automatically saved in the dropbox cloud.
The setting can be enabled/disabled anytime from the application console.
